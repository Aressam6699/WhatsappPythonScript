# WhatsappPythonScript
The script uses selenium webdriver and basic python to partially automate sending whatsapp messages. In case it does'nt work, check the class names used by whatsapp as they might change it later versions of whatsapp. (It is offline and works only on localhost)

### Variables
`
name: name of the person or group'<br>'
message: message to be sent'<br>'
count:number of times you want to send the message'<br>'
`
<br>
(ps: future scope is to use time libraries and automate the wishing birthday, festival, etc. The idea is to have the app hosted on heroku securely and have it read from a google drive a google sheet which can be updated and will be updated in the hosted app every 24 hours
